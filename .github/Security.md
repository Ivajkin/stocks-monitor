# ACS Security  

This document is intended to provide contact and Jira project information to relay vulnerabilities back to the application owner. Vulnerabilities discovered in code or an application must follow the CVSS 3.0 scoring methodology and be remediated according to [ACS Vulnerability Management Standard - 109.02][vulnmgtsdt]. Remediation schedule is found below:

| __CVSS Risk Rating / Jira Priority__ | __Description__                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | __Remediation Timelines__ |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Critical: (9.0 - 10.0) / Blocker     | Exploitation of vulnerabiltiy would likely result in administrative or root level compromise and with little to no interaction with the user.                                                                                                           | Immediately               |
| High:     (7.0 - 8.9)  / Critical    | Exploitation could result in elevated privileges and/or result in the compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.                                                                                                         | 15 Days                   |
| Medium:   (4.0 - 6.9)  / Major       | Compromise of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of resources may be difficult to exploit. Vulnerabilities could require the use of social engineering, require user privileges or the attacker resides within the network or physical access. | 30 Days                   |
| Low:      (0.1 - 3.9)  / Minor       | Vulnerabilities that are the result of unlikely configurations. Exploitation would give limited access to a system and have minimal impact on the environment.                                                                                          | 45 Days                   |
